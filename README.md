This repository is made as a competition entry to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), aimed at making anti-doping education more fun.

# Idea
- AI video storyboard where a student athlete moves from a child athlete to a national athlete then an international athlete and has to make various decisions that may impact their career.
- As a child athlete, the character has the option to watch an AI generated video on the process of giving a sample and get general facts to expect in the future.
- The child athlete gets promoted to a national athlete (whether watching the video or not), and gets to choose what they do in their first doping control process. If they choose incorrectly they may get sanctioned. 
- The national athlete then goes international but also needs to apply for a TUE (Therapeutic Use Exemption) as they develop a condition as they are older and they are given choices for the process, and depending on their choices they can either get sanctioned or continue normally as an athlete.
- 
# Additional features regardless of age:
- Athlete has to choose between different supplements & check against the Prohibited list, and choosing incorrectly may have negative effects on the athlete.  
- Athlete experiences a random check by a Doping Control Officer.
